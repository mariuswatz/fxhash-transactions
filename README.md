# fxhash-transactions
Hack to get user transaction data from the [fxhash](https://fxhash.xyz) NFT platform. Created because fxhash's own "activity" listing isn't so helpful, and fxhash activities aren't tracked by NFTbiker's tools or objkt.com etc.

Uses the fxhash public API to fetch all actions for a given user ID and generate a JSON output.
